# portfolio
Using bootstrap and sass I was able to create a basic website showcasing my portfolio.
If interested in using my code to deploy your website by all means do so.
Few requirements here: make sure you have NPM and NODE, you can download that by googling "npm".
Then install bootstrap, details for that can be found at https://getbootstrap.com
then you'll need to establish sass to update the customizable bootstrap UI. Visit sass for more details.
Once you've done so you'll be able to get going!
