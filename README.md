1.)Using bootstrap and sass I was able to create a basic website showcasing my portfolio.

2.)If interested in using my code to deploy your website by all means do so.

3.)Few requirements here: make sure you have NPM and NODE, you can download that by googling "npm".

4.)Then install bootstrap, details for that can be found at https://getbootstrap.com

5.)Then you'll need to establish sass to update the customizable bootstrap UI. Visit sass for more details.

6.)Once you've done so you'll be able to get going!
